title: Why I am in this Class
---

Corey Bell Sophomore at UNC INLS 161

I am in this class for multiple reasons.

I chose to work in a technological class such as this so I could improve my technological arsenal as far as building websites and making posts.

I am doing this mostly because I am applying into the journalism school and I feel that this class could help tie in into my major with me having to make articles and post on different things.

I also am doing this because I am a novice when it comes to technology and want to become more familiar with things such as github and codeanywhere and building websites. The only technology I am familiar with using is my iPhone an TV.
